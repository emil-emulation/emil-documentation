# EMiL Demo UI

The EMiL project has created a sample UI implementation, demonstrating how to 
use the EMiL RESTful API. The UI is based on Angular (v1).  

The UI consists of two UI projects 

1. [emil-ui](user-workflows.md) representing the user's view. [source repository](../emil-ui)

  This UI demonstrates a typical user workflow, starting from a catalog view selecting a digital object to be rendered.  
2. [emil-admin-ui](admin-workflows.md) providing administrative workflows. [source repository](../emil-admin-ui)

  This UI demonstrates typical curational tasks, such as maintaining emulation environment.
